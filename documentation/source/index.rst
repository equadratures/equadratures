Effective-Quadratures
########################
Effective-Quadratures is a suite of tools for generating polynomials for parametric computational studies. These polynomials may be used to compute approximations to scientific models; more specifically for uncertainty quantification, optimization and numerical integration. This is a research code designed for the development and testing of new polynomial techniques in the areas listed above. The documentation in these pages covers the code's main functionality and its use. All functions are coded in python, so as such this code is not designed for speed. Our motivation for using python is to make this package easily accessible to engineers and scientists, regardless of their scientific computation prowess.

This project has been funded in part from AFOSR and EPSRC.
