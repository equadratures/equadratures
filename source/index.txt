=============

:code:`equadratures` is an open-source python code tailored for tackling problems in **uncertainty quantification**, **surrogate-based optimisation**, **numerical integration**, and **data-driven dimension reduction**.

It does this by constructing orthogonal polynomials. It is particularly useful for problems where output quantities of interest are smooth and continuous and to this extent it has found widespread applications in computational engineering models.

To download and install the code please use the python package index command:

.. code::

	pip3 install equadratures
